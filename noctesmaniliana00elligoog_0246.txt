’οΝ THE NAME OF MANILIUS 227

palpable. Manilius occupies himself mainly with the signs of
the Zodiac and the fixed stars; Firmicus' Mathesis treats of
Astrology as drawn from the planeta. Exactly the same line
was followed by the author of the work known as Manethonis
Apotelesmafica, a Greek poem, mainly in hexameters‚ which in
the 18th century Ludwig Ziegler assigned to the age between
Augustus and Constantine, but which in modern times hasbeen
pronounced by Arminius chhly to be made up of two distinct
poems, one written in the age of Alexander Severus, the other
by a contemporary of Julian.

From Firmicus to the xth century Manilius falls out of sight.
No passage has yet been found written during that interval
which refers to his poem. But though in the xvith and xviith
centones, when astrology was in fashion and poems on as-
trology read, there was especially among the Jesuits, some study
of the literature of the Middle Age, it is only within the last
half century that anything like a comprehensive examination of
this literature has been attempted: and during that time
Manilius has almost wholly ceased to attract the attention of
scholars. It is therefore not impossible that lines or adaptatione
. of the Astronomz‘ca may have escaped notice3 just as, in the
parallel case of the Ibis, no one before myself had observed that
one whole verse has been transferred almost unaltered to the
Commonr'lorzam of the Christian poet Orientius¹.

Manilius reemerges in the earliest and best MS of his poem
at the end of the xth or early m the xith century. This rs the
codex Gcmblacensr's, so named from the Belgian village Gembloux,
a monastery in which was long the possessor of this unique
treasure. Another copy, written according to Bechert, about 50
years later, is now at Leipsic. The CusanuS, which I have myself
partially collated, is assigned by Oehler to the xiith century.

Thes'e MSS though closely agreeing bave yet so many points
