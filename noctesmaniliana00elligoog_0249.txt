230 ΟΝ THE NAME OF MANILIUS

Manilids, could not be Boetius. For not only is Marcus no part
of Boetius' name, but Gerbert in another passage of his letters
speaks of Boetius, as we might expect, by this single name
and by no other. And though we cannot praue that the de
astrologia Gerbert asks for is a poem, the fact that such a poem
is known to have been extant in the xth and xith centurieS, and
Α the actual ascription of it to M. Mallius (another form of

Manlius) in a MS written indeed in 1470, yet obviously copied
from a very much earlier archetype, seem to more than justify
the prevailing identification.

Inv the socalled Dialogus super auctores of Konrad of
Hirschau, a monh of the xiiith century, I have noted one
passage which may possibly refer to our poem, p. 79 ed.
Schepps 1889, clementorum discors concordia quidus nisi astro·
logicis pateret auctoribus? Man. 1. 140 sqq. cuin per se cuncta
errarint Frigida nec calidis desintaut humida si'cci's, Spiritus out
siccis, si'tquc hacc discordia concors, Quae nexus habilis et opus
generabile fingi'tAtquc omnis portus clementa rapacia reddit. The
same combination discordia concors recurs in a corrupt verse at
the end of the poem, V. 728¹). Is there any other auctor astra-
logicus to whom the words of Konrad could with equal aptness
be referred? Yet since the actual combination concordi'a discors,
not discordia concors, is found in Ovid M. i. 433, Horace Epp.
i. 12. 29, Lucan i. 98, the above ascription to Manilius must
remain uncertain.

I must mention here a fact of some importance, to which
the Dutch scholar Woltjer was the first to call attention. At
least I can find no reference to it either in Iacob or Bechert
Itis the discovery of a new codex of Manilius in Switzerland
by Poggio during the session of the Council of Constance, 1416-
1417 nn.

The earliest writer who alludes to this is Francesco Barbara.
In a letter to Poggio dated cx Veneti'is pridie nonas i'icli'cis anno
Christi M. CCCCX VII the following sentence occurs: Tu
Tertullianum, tu Marcum Fabium Quintilianum, tu Q. Ascanium
Pedianum, tu Lucretium, Silium Italicum, Marcellinum, tu Mani·
