224 , ΟΝ THE NAME OF MANILIUS ²

follows that we have in this superscriptlon a genuine tradition
handed down from an early period. That period may have
been the age of Firmicus ; but it may have been later, the age ol
Charlemagne. The parade of titles dwelt on above might not
inaptly suit that epoch of revived but imperfect knowledge ; the
substantial fact, the M. Mollii'Astronomicon libri V, would be
a survival from a much earlier time.

It may be well at this point to state the facts, so far as they
are discoverable, as to the knowledge oi Manilius’ poemin
classical times

It is usual to essert that the poem is not mentioned by any
Roman writer. It is certain that Manilius is not included in
the list ol poets mentioned by Ovid in the Tristia or that in the
last book ol Epistles from Pontus, and that he is ignored by
Quintilian. But it has not been observed that Ovid, although
he has nowhere mentioned Manilius by name, seems to allude
to two passages of his Vth book in these verses of the Trziteiz n
485, 486 Ecce canitsormas alens eiectusque pilarum, Hic arten
nandipraeczbit, ille trochi. The description of the various ways .
of swimming (Man. V. 420-431) is one of Manilius' happiest
efforts ; the lines about ball-playing (165-171) are less detailed,
but equally felicitous. Rudolf Merkel believed that the person
whom Ovid attacked in his Ibis was Manilius, founding his view
on the word Poeni which is added to his name in one MS.
Though the uncertainty of this word, which as we have seen is
spelt Boeni, Boeci, Boetii in other MSS, makes it of little value
asan argument, there are at least two points in which the
writer of the Ibis might seem to allude to Manilius. The first
is the astrological reference Ib. 211-220 Natus es infelen, ita
di uolnere, nec nlla Commoda nascenti stella lentim sui't. Non
Venus illuxit, non illa Iuppiter horn. Lunaque non apto solque
fuere loce. Nec satzi utiliter positos tibi praebuit ignes, Quen
peperit magno lucida Maia Ioui. Te fera nec quidquem
placidum spondentia Martis Sidera presserunt, falciferique senti.
Lux quoqne natalis, ne quid nisi triste uideres, Turpis et induent
nubibus atra snit. This is, 1 believe, the' single passage in any
