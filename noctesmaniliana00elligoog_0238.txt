ΟΝ THE NAME OF MANILIUS - 219

second collation is extant in the royal library oi Berlin, gives
this extra nameas Poeni (Bentl. Praei. p.xi, Bechert de emend.
Manil. p. 15). Ι

The other xvth century MSS agree in giving the name as
M. Mallius Manlius, or Manilius. Thus in the MS in the

library of Corpus Christi at Oxiord (o) the poet is always

Manilius: in the Bodleian codex (b) always Manlius.

‘ Whence did this name come into the MSS? Was it in·

troduced in the xvth century, or transmitted from the Middle
Age?- ·

Bentley thought it was introduced in the xvth century, by·
some scholar who identified the Manlzns Antiochus astrologiae
conditor oi Plin. H. N. xxxv. 199 with the author of our
astrologica] poem in five books. Freier, taking the heading ol
the Vossianus secundus as typical os the whole collection of
xvth century tituli, points to the accumulation ol names by which
Augustus is addressed in it, Dino Oct. Quirino Augusto, as a,
mark oi lateness, and ascribes it to some contemporary oi the
astrological writer Firmicus¹. Combining Man. Ι. 7 Hunc mihi
tu Caesar patriae princepsque paterque Qui regis augustos parentent
legibus orbem with 800, 89¹ Quod regit Angustus socri> per sz'gna
Tonante Cernit et in coetu Drinum magnumque anrrnum, he may
have constructed· out os these lines the unskilful whole Diuo Oct.
Quz'rz'no Auguste, an inept accumulation oi titles which un·
mistakably betrays the Byzantine epoch oi its composition.
Thus made up, the heading passed, Freier thinks, from one
copy os the poem to another, long before the period at which it
is mentioned by Gerbert, towards the end of the xth century.

A third view is that the words os Gerbert M. Manlius ale
Astrologia are the only foundation ior the name in the xvth
century MSS.

Ishall try to show—

(ι) That no theory which regards the name as an introduc·
tion os the xvth century is likely.

¹ Firmicus wrote under Constantine.
