false ascription‚ Arati Astronornican. The Cusanus has oc·

though, thanks to M. Paul Thomas, we now possess a perfect
and accurate collation ol G, our knowledge oi the Lipsiensis
(Iacob's L) and Cusanus (Iacob’s C) is still incomplete. It
seems, however, probable that at least two distinct copies of
the poem were in circulation at a time considerably anterior to
900 nn: and it would follow that it had been diligently copied
in the revival ol classical studies under Charlemagne.

.. It was towards the close of the xth century that Gerbert, the

¹ Victorius is supposed to be the Victorinus who wrote an Expositio in
Rhetorica Ciceronis. Demosthenes Philalethes was a Greek physician ol the
Augustan age who wrote on the pulse and three books on affectione of the
eyes (Havet Epistt. Gerberti p. 7 note). Gerbert speaks of this Demosthenes
in an earlier letter (Havet p. 7) to one Abbot Gisalbert thus, De morbis ac
remediis-oculorum Demostenes philosophus librum edidit qui inscribitur
Ophthalmicus. In both passages Gerbert seems to mean a Latin work, as
Havet suggests. Was it a translation?
