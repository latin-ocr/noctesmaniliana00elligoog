identical with the M. Mallius, M. Mallius Boenus which stand
respectively at the beginning oi Β.Ι and at the end of B. II
in the Voss.² Which of the two forms, M. Manilius Boetius,
M. Mallius Boenus, more faithfully represents the doubtless

obscured writing of the S. Gallen codex, it would be rash to
pronounce. The Spanish codex has the advantage in priority
os time, the 'Leyden in simplicity and rude faithfulness to its
original. Antiochus forms no partos the name, and cannot
have been in the S. Gallen codex. But against the genuineness
of the other names (whatever formis the right one) I can see
no plausible ground os objection. We may feel assured that
they were copied direct from the codex3 and as this, like the
other codices discovered at S. Gallen by Poggio, was no doubt
ancient, the name ol the poet of the Astronomica must have
been handed down with the same fidelity which has preserved
the names of Q. Asconius Pedianus, and Gaius Valerius Flaccus
Balbus Setinus.
