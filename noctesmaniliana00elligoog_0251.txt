This codex (M 31) forms the first portion of a complete MS
the second hali oi which (X 81) contains f. 1-17 a chronicle,
f. 261-64r the commentary of Asconius Pedianus¹‚ i. 65r
Valerius Flaccus² i. ii. iii. iv. 1-317 3 after which is the following
subscriptio, C. Valeri flocci argonaua'con. Hoc fragmenti repunt

Both wae and Beer agree in considering these two MSS
to be different parts os one whole. We have therefore here,
in a single codex, the four works rediscovered by Poggio‚ as
stated in the subscriptio oi the Florentine MS of Asconius cited
above. Ltiwe sarther states that the Asconius and Valerius
Flaccus, which are not in the same handwriting as the Manilius
and Statius, may have been written by Poggio, to whom he
seems also to ascribe the corrections on the first page of the
Statius.

It is observahle that all these witnesses speak of Manilius as
re-dz‘scooered by Poggio. Itis clear that they did not know
of the existence of any other MSS, the Gemblacensis, Lipsiensis,
or Cusanus. It may be inserted therefore with more than pro-
bability that no copy of the Astronomica was then known to
be extant in Italy. We may perhaps conclude that Poggio's
transcript of the S. Gallen MS was the parent of all the xvth
century Italian codices.

What then is the name of the poet in perhaps the earliest
os these copies, that in the National Library of Madrid? -
He is called at the commencement oi B. l M. Manilius, at
the end oi B. II M. Manilius Boetius. This is practically
