ΟΝ THE NAME OF MANILIUS 225

work ascribed to Ovid which dwells minutely on astrological
details in connexion with any one’s horoscope. The second point
is the recunence twice of the rare word multiplicare. Ib. 206
Ora lieet tribuas multiplicato mt'le', 644 Multiplicentque suo uota

fauore uua. The fondness of Manilius for arithmetic and par· ,
ticularly multiplicatiori sums must have struck every reader of ·

the poem comically. See II. 3²1 sqq, III. 260, 279 sqq,
423-617, IV. 445-497. Thirdly, the Ibts has at least one
marked feature of Manilius' style, a double que attached to the
two last words ofa hexameter, e. g. 177 saxum uoluensque
petensque ¹.

Professor J. E. B. Mayor thinks Juvenal may have imitated
Manilius in x. 175 constratum classibus eidem (mare) cf. Manil.
I. 776 Perseidos et uictor strurut que' classibus aequor, and in the
declamatory passages on Hannibal, x. 155, 165, cf. Man. IV.
37 Quid referum Connus admotoque moenibus armat, and Xerxes
cf. Iuv. x. 179 sqq. with Mau. IV. 65, 66 Ouid Xerxem, mutus
et ipso Naufragium pelago. These indeed are doubtful. WoltJer

· however (de Manilio poeta, Groningen, p. 16) cites from a poem
de Luna attributed in the MSS to a certain Claudius (Anth.
Lat. Riese 723, Bihrens P. L. M. iii. 163) the following verse—
Luna decus mundi, magni pars maxima caeli,
which is certainly from Manilius V. 12-
Hinc uocat Orion, magni pars maxima caeli.

In the age of Constantine we can point to one writer who
knew and used Manilius, the author of the Latin treatise on
Astrology, Julius Firmicus. Scaliger has collected the passages
in this work which are modelled on Manilius' poem, and more
recently Bechert has cited the most remarkable of them de
emend. Manil. p. 18. Two of them bear traces of a very
close imitation. Man. V. 61 sqq.

¹ The genuineness oi the Ibis can hardly be considered quite established.
The curious agreement of 4s‚6w1th the torture aud deathof the Christian
Theodotus loots like terpolation, tosa the least. See my paper
mthe Journal of Phrlolog for1885‚ pp 93- -“1,66 ‘New suggestions ou the
Jttsss and the' ingenious, if hardly prohable view of my friend Mr. R. W.
Raper, which' rs appended as a note to the same article.
