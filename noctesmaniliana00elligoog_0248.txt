ΟΝ THE NAME OF MANILIUS 229

suppose that Gerbert had been informed ol the existence of such
a poem and wrote according to the description he had heard.
Other¹ allusions to astrology are found in the letters ol Gerbert
as well as in the Latin poems ascribed to him. He was besides
an indefatigable collector ol MSS, and fills his letters with
requests to his friends to procure'. copies of such authors as he
did not possess ². His correspondents were instructed to procure
him manuscripts lrom Italy, Germany, and Belgium. It need
not then surprise us to find him asking lor a copy ol M. Manlius
on Astrology. It is however objected by Havet that this might
be a prose⁸ treatise; and if so perhaps by Anicius Manlius
Boetius Severinus, who is known to have written on the stars.
Allowing that the work alluded to by Gerbert may have been in
prose, Ι yet consider it certain that its author, M. Manlius or

¹ P. 19 flavet, Librum de astrologia translatum a te michi petenti dirige
et si quid mei uoles in recompensationem indubitate reposce. P. 44 Fenx
dies, felix hora, qua licuit nouisse uirum. P. 70 (in the 4 hexameters, no
doubt by Gerbert, on the Arehbishop Adalberon), cum te Praestantem
cunctis mortalibus abstulit orbi Quinta dies fundentis aquas cum pondere
rerum. Both fundentes aquas and pandere rerum are Manilian, the former
is used several times=Aquarii, the latter occurs IV. 205 Mensurae tribuent
(Chelae, the Balance) usus ac pondera rerum. P. 135 contains a long passage
about the incrementa of the hours at different times of the year, with a table
of months. In this Gerbert draws lrom Martianus Capella. P. 131, he had
constructed a sphere which, however, cannot be finished in a perfect form
with coloured horizon lor want ol time.

¹ 1 have noted the following: Suetonius Tranquillus, Q. Aurelius Sym·
machus, Cicero’s Verrine Orations and De Republica, the Achilleis of
Statius, and a missing portion ol Boetius' Commentary on Aristotle's περὶ

M· Manlius de Astrologia above mentioned. We may be sure that Gerbert
wrote ol the works as he had seen them himself or heard them described.
Why should he speak of the same work alternately as viii uolumina Bacta'i
dc Astrologa'a and then as M. Manlius da Astrologia? At any rate amongst
the numerous appellations of Boetius the least distinctiva is Manlius. And
Gerbert says M. Manlius, a praenomen to which Boetius makes no claim.
