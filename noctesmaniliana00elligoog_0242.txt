ΟΝ THE NAME OF MANILIUS 223

. original of Voss.², and 1470 the date of the completion of

Voss.² ,itseli il the words EQ. ROM. appear in Voss.² as
EQOM, the original of that MS would seem to remount to a
much higher antiquity.

· The same reasoning may be applied to Boem'. The explana·
tion of this name may be irrecoverable3 but its very peculiarity
marks it as genuine, or at least as a corruption ol something ’
genuine.

Lastly‚ there is no reason to question the word Astro-
nomicon. It forms an integral part of a whole not open to
suspicion. Its agreement in this MS of 1470 with the name of
the poem as given in tvo MSS of the earliest date (Cusanus
Lipsiensis) does not indeed help us, as though they call the
poem by the same name, they ascribe it to Aratus.

Spealring from a more general point of view, 1 cannot but
again protest against the damnatory view pronounced by the
late Emilius B'ahrens upon MSS of the xvth century. It is
certainly true that many MSS written between 1400 and 1500
'are so deeply interpolated as to be almost or quite worthless.
But it is equally certain that some MSS were copied, in that
period of restless classical revival‚ from originals of the highest
antiquity. The single name of Poggio is enough to illustrate
and prove my meaning. Such, I imagine, was the case with
the Vossianus secundus. Its excellences are too great, often too
disguised, to admit any hypothesis of interpolation or vamping.
In the caseos Manilius, it is certain that, if we had not this
MS of 1470, the Gemblacensis of cent. x or xi, the Cusanus,
and the Lipsiensis, both seemingly not later than cent. xii, would
leave us in doubt as to the restoration of not a few passages.

2. If then the Voss.2 takes rank with other MSS copied indeed
in the xvth century but copied from a'n ancient archetype3 .if
it is hazardous to accuse the scribe who wrote it of grafting
a xvth century superscription upon an otherwise unsophisticated
document; if the supposed xvth century superscription is, as it
stands, unintelligible without correction, and the very same
kind ol correction which applies to the whole ol the MS; it
