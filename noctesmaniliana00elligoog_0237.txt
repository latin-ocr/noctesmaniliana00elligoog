the Phaenomena os Aratus in aLatin form, but had no farther
knowledge of any of the three versions by Cicero, Germanicus,
Avienus in which the Greek original has been preserved, may
have supposed the five books of hexameters on the stars to
be a Latinized Aratus.

Or, as is more probable‚ the work of Manilius was contained
in the same volume with one of the Latin versions of Aratus,
and the name was carelessly transferred from the poem to which
it rightly belonged to a work on the same subject, which itself
had been left without a title.

It is not till the xvth century that any MS supplies the
name. Itis given variously in these as M. Mallius, Manlius, or
Manilius. The most important of these MSS, the Vossianus
secundus, gives the heading of B. Ι thus

M Mallii EQOM astronomicon diuo oct quurrino augs
proemium lib' pr. At the end of B. I is written Marcii Mallii
astronomicon liber primus explicit.

At the end of B. II the same MS has M Mallii boeni astro·
nomicon liber ii¹1⁸ explicit feliciter: and again B. ΙΙΙ at the end
has M. Mallii astronomicon liber iiius explicit.

The addition of Boeni occurs only here3 and the name is not
found either at the beginning or end of the 4th and 5th
books. An Urbino codex in the Vatican, 668 (803), gives the
name in the form M. Manilii Boeci. Another MS, M 31 in the
National Library of Madrid (Bibliothec. Patrum Latinorum
Hispaniensis i. p. 454), of the early xvth century giyes the name
at the end ol B. II as M. Manilii Boeh'i. It might seem
therefore that Boeni was a corruption of Boen'ior Boeci, and that
the work was attributed to Boetius, the famous author of the dc
Consolatione Philosophiae. Boetius is known to have written on
Astronomy, and has been thought to be the M. Manlius of whose
treatise de Astrologio Gerbert, afterwards Pope Silvester 11, begs
his friend, the monk Rainard, to procure him a copy together with
Victorius de rhetorica and the ophthalmicus of Demosthenes.
(Havet, Lettres de Gerbert p. 117). But another MS of
Manilius, ol which Bentley possessed a collation, and ol which a
